blueprint:
  name: Miele Appliance Finished
  description: >-
    Notifies and triggers actions when a Miele washing machine or tumble dryer
    finishes its program (requires the official Miele integration in Home
    Assistant Core).

    **When the program ends:**

    - Creates a persistent Home Assistant notification.
    - Sends a push notification to each person's own Companion App device(s),
      but **only** to persons who are currently in the home zone. If Person A
      and Person B are configured but only Person B is home, only Person B's
      device receives the notification.
    - Turns on a configurable alert light (color, effect, brightness).
    - Runs any additional custom actions you define.

    **When the appliance leaves the "program ended" state:**

    - Dismisses the persistent notification.
    - Turns off the alert light.
    - Runs any additional reset actions you define.

    > **Tip:** Create one automation per appliance and set a different
    > *Notification ID* for each so their notifications do not interfere.
